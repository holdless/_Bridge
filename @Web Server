0. TCP vs. HTML(web) server:
  -TCP is on TCP layer.
  -HTML is on Application layer.
  -some programming languages' APIs implement HTML protocol (and of course they have to implement TCP protocol for packages transmission)
  -Ideally, "what you put in makes what it is", if you implement HTML protocol interface, this server is of course a web-server 
1. http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Web_server#C上面的code是for linux OS, hard to implement with VC on Windows.
2. try:Java/Python web-server code test:
3. try:C call Java/Python web-server test:

1. test web-server code on OSX with C/Java --> the result is weird, connection unstable 
    ==> try to test on Win tomorrow
